#### Description:
#### Problem:

Tracking expenses via Google Sheet provides great analytical capabilities, but entering data means a lot of manual work (~2-3 hrs per week) which is not doable from a mobile phone.

The author's experience with expense tracking apps has shown they have great UI, but their analytical capabilities are limited. It is a subjective opinion.

#### Solution:
Alfredo addresses the above-mentioned problem by providing a chatbot interface for entering data to a user-defined Gsheet. Compared to entering data to Gsheets directly, it has the following benefits:

- It can be used via phone which enables adding data on costs via phone as soon as they happen.
- Due to the already mentioned accessibility, no dedicated laptop sessions are required thus the expense tracking can be done in a timelier manner.
